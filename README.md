NOTES:
- A simple, yet complete, puzzle game.
- Features a TitleScreen, MainGame and GameOver state.
- Objective is to use right/left mouse button to rotate pipe pieces to form a pipe chain that connects the left side with the right side of the board.
- When a pipe chain is completed, water flows out and the water level in the tank gets smaller.
- It's GameOver if the player cannot form enough pipe chains to prevent the water level from reaching the top of the tank.
- Features a simple animation when pieces are falling in place, when rotated and when fading away.
- Features a simple score system where the longer the pipe chain formed, the more points the player gets.
- Features a simple progression system where at every 10 completed pipe chains, difficulty level increases. Each next level causes the water level in the tank to rise faster (creates a sense of urgency).
